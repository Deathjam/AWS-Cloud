### AWS-Cloud Module

This module contains some handy functions to expedite the creation of a virtual private cloud.  

This was written during my learning stage of AWS and how each component relates to each other.  

The module is not in PS Gallery, so you'll need to download it from GitHub to install it.  

I've also recorded a demo of how it works.

The recording was done with Terminalizer by the way.
So if anyone wants to replay it on his own PowerShell console, just use the demo-aws.yml file in the Notes folder.

```powershell
terminalizer play demo-aws.yml
```
